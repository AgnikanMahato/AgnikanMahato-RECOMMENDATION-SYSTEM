# RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM:

We will develop a search engine that will be based on data from Amazon to find 10 relevant products for the user.

We will use an NLP model that will apply the user's query to Amazon products and evaluate the similarity between them.

To develop a search engine, it is important to access data from a database so that we can efficiently incorporate product information into the search and recommendation system.

Stamp tokens are created with the product title and description, which helps to check similarity and improve the recommendation system.

# Introduction and Objective of the Project:

In this project, we will develop a search engine that will be based on data from Amazon. The objective is to ensure that when a user enters a product in the search box and clicks the Search button, he gets 10 relevant products along with their descriptions. Through this process, we will get a chance to understand important aspects of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

"We will create a search engine that will work on Amazon product data."

# Development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model:

We will first create a model that will use Natural Language Processing. This model will compare the user's query with Amazon products. For this, we must first download the data set and store it in a suitable structure.

"We will first create a model in Natural Language Processing."

# Product Data and its Preparation:
To work on this project, we need to download the Amazon product data set. Next, we need to go through some preliminary processes. This will include cleaning the data, getting the titles and descriptions into the proper format, so that we can extract the correct and useful information.

This will include converting the titles to lower case and tokenizing the various words. Next, we will use stemming techniques to get the correct form of the required words.

"We have to tokenize the various words and use stemming techniques."

# Working of the Search Engine:
When the user performs a search, we will evaluate the similarity between the title and the description. For this, we use a machine learning model. This model will find the closest 10 products, based on the collected data. This process acts as an automated search engine, designed to improve the user experience.

"We will try to show 10 relevant products to the user through the search engine."

# Stamp Tokens and Similarity System:

The video explains that first we create a format called 'Stamp Tokens', which contains the title and description of the product. Through this we check the similarity. Now we have restored a new term 'Similarity' for Amazon.

This process works based on the stamp tokens present in our data set and the user's interaction. We want to ensure that if any kind of similarity is found, it is stored.

This identification shows that we get help in getting information related to the user's query.

"If the similarity is checked, store it."

# System Recommendation Process:

In this process we recommend newly proposed products. This involves accessing data from a database, which helps us to present the product efficiently.

Also, if action is given by a company, we can put the recommendation system into the website.

In the next project, we will develop a search engine as well as access data from the database, which will make it even more functional.

"After accessing from the database, it is easy to bring the recommendation system into the website."
